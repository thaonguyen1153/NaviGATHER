PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCEMedtronic Inc Mounds View MN Nov 2015 Sept 2016Software Verification Engineer Contract EXB Solutions Software verification engineer SWVT on the CRT P Quad physician s application software This is a clinical device used by the physician to interface with a patient s implanted pacemaker This software is developed on open source hardware OSH in a Medtronic custom device My role was primarily automated test development used in the formal verification of the application software C compilers are used but the architecture is structure based and not object oriented TFS is the version and work instruction control environment I also was responsible for test fixtures and firmware used in the fixtures The test fixtures are CRT P Quad hybrids I had a large number of years of experience in this area and had assisted developed some of the tools this group uses Minnetronix Inc St Paul MN Nov 2014 Sept 2015QA Engineer Design Engineer Contract Aerotek Quality assurance QA engineer on the Pioneer SMR project This project was a verification of software changes made to an existing ventricular assist device VAD I designed hardware PIC16F1828 firmware C and software UI LabView PCB Layout PCB123 a test instrument to simulate a smart battery and verify the system management bus SMBus I successfully completed this and other verification tasks including the uncovering and resolving issues found and remained with Minnetronix to do electrical engineering and software design work on the next generation device I primarily focused on communication interfaces and noise coupling issues of the previous design including EMI EMC of the system implemented PCB layout and filtering improvements Medtronic Inc Mounds View MN 1998 2013Sr Principal Design Technician 2011 2013Managed automated test development schedules resources design and analysis on each project following code compliance protocols required in the highly regulated medical technologies field Designed Microchip PIC based hardware firmware and software for instruments used in development mechanical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI labs reducing test setup and LabView test development time and complexity I used an RS232 interface between this device and the test console PC to simplify the addition of this equipment to existing test racks Guided teams in the development of automated and manual tests for all functional blocks of Medtronic cardiac devices providing the tools needed for research manufacturing and FDA submission of Medtronic devices Lead pilot team in the use of Lean Design Controls implemented to simultaneously deliver quality while reducing project waist The team successfully implemented the program and was able to identify and remove 67 documents reports that had no project value but had been costing the project in time and resources Principal Design Technician 2003 2011Automated test development team lead and test lead developer on a number of device projects working cross functional with research hardware firmware manufacturing and software in the development and FDA submission of a number of implantable pacemakers and defibrillators Designed hardware firmware and software for the PIC16F1933 XYZ Stepper motion controller that successfully showed the benefits of using a 3D physical placement instrument to reduce testing idle times shortening the device verification schedule by 18 and reducing the number of resources needed for the blocks being covered I used Microchips verification tools that allow for the firmware to be executed against behavioral models derived in P Spice This was done to verify stepper drive patterns during the development and to make sure the voltage references for the chopper circuits I used would not be impacted when certain fet firing sequences took place Developed hardware firmware and software for the PIC16F1933 Fill and Exhaust pneumatic mechanical test unit that increased the number of units tested at a time from 1 to 8 reducing schedule and resource costs significantly I used RS232 to communicate between the test console PC and the master control device I used P Spice and ICE to model hardware and firmware interactions to verify system and interrupt service routine timing before building a physical unit Wrote Real time Data Analysis function that ties device vector and requirements to the automated test being executed preventing user interaction errors and pass fail results during testing which reduces the amount of time required to post process results and allows issues to be uncovered earlier in the testing cycle Sr Design Technician 1998 2003Automated and manual test developer and executor for the FDA submission of anumber of Medtronic products working cross functionally These tests include the use of equipment such as O scopes spectrum analyzers multi meters signal generators frequency counters Authored Software Development Protocol which provides the guidelines for the development and validation of software used to characterize and verify cardiac devices The protocol creates a consistent and high quality environment and has been adopted by all hardware test labs located in CRDM Key contributor who participated in the development of a hardware test system that allowed for the reuse of 80 of code from project to project Efforts resulted in significant test development time and cost reductions The efficiencies of this test engine has resulted in the system being adopted by all hardware test labs in CRDM
